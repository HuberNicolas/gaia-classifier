# Space Data Classifier Project: gaia-classifier

This repository contains the code and report for a machine learning (ML) classifier project focused on space data related to the Gaia project. This project was part of the 32130 FDA Competition AUT 2024 for the course "32130 Fundamentals in Data Analytics" at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in Fall 2024. I achieved a top score of 1.0 in the Kaggle competition associated with this assignment, where the goal was to build classifiers to predict the spectral class by Gaia, specifically targeting the SpType-ELS column in the dataset.

## Contents

- Code for data analysis and classifier development.
- Final report detailing the project, methodology, and results.

## Introduction

This is the final report on a machine learning (ML) classifier project that aims to create a classifier for space data related to the Gaia project. The report is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: An overview of the project and its goals.
2. **Data Mining Problem and Task Details**: A detailed description of the data mining problem and the specific tasks involved.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Information on the preprocessing steps applied to the data.
4. **Problem-Solving Approach**: A concrete description of how to solve the problem, including the underlying reasoning.
5. **Classifiers Used**: Descriptions of the different classifiers used in the project.
6. **Performance Results**: Demonstration of the performance of the different classifiers, including hyperparameter tuning results.
7. **Evaluation and Selection**: Discussion on the evaluation and selection of the best classifier.
8. **Conclusion and Reflection**: Personal reflection on data mining and classification as a typical data mining problem.
9. **Appendix A**: Additional material and resources.
